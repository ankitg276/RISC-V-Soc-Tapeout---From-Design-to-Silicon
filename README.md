## ‚ú® Project overview

This repository is my public log as a program participant: design notes, artifacts, reports and visuals produced while following the India RISC-V Tapeout Program ‚Äî *From Design to Silicon*. The program pairs hands-on RTL‚ÜíSynthesis‚ÜíPhysical design labs with mentorship from academia and industry to enable participant tapeouts using open-source toolchains.

**Program partners / collaborators (high level):**

* Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar ‚Äî IITGN. ([IIT Gandhinagar][1])
* VLSI System Design (VSD) ‚Äî training & tooling partner. ([VLSI System Design][2])
* India Electronics & Semiconductor Association (IESA). ([iesaonline.org][3])
* RISC-V International. ([RISC-V International][4])
* Digital India RISC-V (DIR-V) initiative and related community events.
* VLSI Society of India (VSI) and other ecosystem supporters.

> Note: VSD‚Äôs VSD-IAT platform hosts the program sign-up and task distribution. ([vsdiat.vlsisystemdesign.com][5])

## What this repository contains (owner's view)

* A single place for my program deliverables: design notes, RTL snapshots, small artifacts (thumbnails, reports), and a concise changelog.
* Clear, reproducible metadata and README files for each deliverable so others can review my progress and findings.
* Visuals (banners, layout thumbnails, waveform images) to make the story easy to scan at a glance.
* Minimal large binaries ‚Äî full GDS or large datasets are referenced and stored off-repo when required.

---

## Repo niceties (how I present work)

* A prominent banner image at `assets/banner.png` (or `assets/banner.gif`) showing a layout mockup or waveform snippet to make the project page visually striking.
* A short project blurb in the GitHub description:
  *‚ÄúFrom Verilog to GDS: Weekly lab progress for the India RISC-V Tapeout Program ‚Äî documenting RTL ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Physical Design ‚Üí Tapeout using open-source EDA.‚Äù*
* Lightweight badges for environment setup, smoke tests (sim/synth), and license status.
