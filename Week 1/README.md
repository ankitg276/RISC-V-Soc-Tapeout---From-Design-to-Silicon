## üß≠ Overview & Objectives

This week introduces the core concepts and workflows used in an open‚ÄëPDK tapeout environment using the SkyWater sky130 process. The emphasis of this introduction file is conceptual clarity ‚Äî what each tool does, why we use it, and what you should learn from each day.

**Key concepts covered during the week:**

* Verilog RTL structure and semantics (combinational vs sequential, module boundaries, parameterization)
* Functional simulation to verify behavior before synthesis
* Logic synthesis to map RTL to gates/primitives
* Common synthesis pitfalls and how they lead to simulation mismatches
* Early RTL optimization techniques (combinational, sequential, coding style)

**Learning outcomes:**

* Understand how and why simulation, synthesis, and gate‚Äëlevel flows fit together in a tapeout pipeline
* Recognize constructs that synthesize poorly or cause mismatches
* Know how to read synthesis reports at a high level and where to look for common problems

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites & Setup

Recommended environment: **Ubuntu (WSL2)** or native Linux. Windows users should prefer WSL2 for tool compatibility. Tools used in Week 1 labs include Icarus Verilog (iverilog), GTKWave, Yosys, and the SkyWater sky130 PDK.

**Quick install (Ubuntu / WSL):**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y iverilog gtkwave yosys git make
```

> Note: The course may require additional PDK/OpenLane/OpenROAD setup for later labs ‚Äî those steps will be documented inside the specific day‚Äëwise lab README files and the course installer notes.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è High‚Äëlevel workflow (no commands)

This introduction describes the conceptual flow used in the labs (the precise commands and scripts live in the day‚Äëwise readmes):

* **Design & RTL:** Implement modules in Verilog using clear interfaces, parameters for widths, and self‚Äëcontained units that are easy to test.
* **Testbench & Simulation:** Create testbenches that exercise corner cases and produce waveform output for debugging. The goal is functional verification ‚Äî confirming the design behaves as intended.
* **Synthesis:** Use a logic synthesis tool to transform RTL into a gate‚Äëlevel netlist that approximates how the design will appear in silicon. Pay attention to synthesis reports: cell counts, inferred structures, and warnings.
* **GLS & Mismatch Checking:** Optionally perform gate‚Äëlevel simulation (GLS) using the synthesized netlist to detect functional mismatches introduced by synthesis. Investigate the causes (inferred latches, X propagation, reset differences).
* **Iterate & Optimize:** Based on simulation and synthesis observations, apply RTL changes to eliminate anti‚Äëpatterns, improve area/timing, and reduce unexpected inference.

## üìÜ Day‚Äëwise plan & topic explanations

Below are detailed explanations of the topics for each day. The **lab steps, commands, expected outputs and examples** for each topic will be provided inside the corresponding `dayX/README.md` files.

### **DAY 1 ‚Äî Verilog RTL design & Simulation**

**Core topics explained:**

* **Verilog RTL fundamentals:** Modules, ports, parameters, continuous assignments, procedural blocks. Distinguish between behavioral descriptions (for simulation/verification) and structural descriptions (for mapping to gates).
* **Testbench principles:** How to write self‚Äëchecking testbenches, stimulus generation, and organizing tests to clearly show pass/fail conditions.
* **Waveform analysis:** What waveforms reveal ‚Äî signal timing relationships, glitches, and unexpected X values.
* **Synthesis intro:** What synthesis does conceptually ‚Äî translating RTL into gates, inferring registers and simple optimizations.

**Lab focus (conceptual):** Create simple, self‚Äëcontained modules (e.g., mux, adder), write testbenches that assert correct behavior, and view waveforms to validate timing and logic.

---

### **DAY 2 ‚Äî Timing libraries, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis & Flop coding styles**

**Core topics explained:**

* **Timing libraries (.lib):** What information a liberty file contains ‚Äî cell timing arcs, pin capacitances, timing checks ‚Äî and why they matter later in physical design and STA.
* **Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis:** Benefits and tradeoffs of preserving or flattening hierarchy ‚Äî modularity vs global optimization, debugability vs resource and runtime considerations.
* **Flop / register coding styles:** Different ways to code registers (synchronous vs asynchronous reset, enable usage, clock gating), how synthesis interprets those styles, and the optimization implications for timing and power.

**Lab focus (conceptual):** Explore different register encodings and observe how they appear post‚Äësynthesis and how they affect optimization opportunities.

---

### **DAY 3 ‚Äî Combinational and Sequential Optimizations**

**Core topics explained:**

* **Combinational logic optimizations:** Constant propagation, dead‚Äëcode elimination, expression simplification, and how bitwise/vector encodings affect logic generation.
* **Sequential optimizations:** Register sharing, retiming, and trimming unused outputs; how choice of state encoding and register placement impacts area and timing.

**Lab focus (conceptual):** Compare synthesized results of naive vs optimized implementations to learn what coding patterns reduce gate count and improve timing.

---

### **DAY 4 ‚Äî GLS, Blocking vs Non‚Äëblocking & Synth‚ÄëSim mismatch**

**Core topics explained:**

* **Blocking (`=`) vs non‚Äëblocking (`<=`) semantics:** Behavioral effects in sequential code, ordering implications in simulation, and best practices to avoid race conditions.
* **Synthesis‚Äësimulation mismatch causes:** Why inferred latches, uninitialized signals, or different reset behaviors lead to mismatches‚Äîhow to identify and correct them.
* **Gate‚Äëlevel simulation (GLS):** Purpose and limitations; GLS helps find problems that only appear after synthesis but should be used judiciously due to complexity.

**Lab focus (conceptual):** Introduce scenarios where mismatches occur and discuss how to refactor RTL to be synthesis‚Äëfriendly and simulation‚Äëpredictable.

---

### **DAY 5 ‚Äî Optimization in synthesis**

**Core topics explained:**

* **IF / CASE semantics in synthesis:** Priority vs parallel semantics, how defaults and coverage affect latch inference, and how to write explicit, synthesis‚Äëfriendly constructs.
* **Incomplete & overlapping cases:** Why omission of branches can create unintended state (latches) and how to prevent that with defaults or explicit assignments.
* **For / generate usage:** Parameterized replication of logic and when to use generate constructs for scalable hardware description.

**Lab focus (conceptual):** Exercise incomplete/overlapping constructs and `for`/`generate` patterns to see how synthesis maps them to hardware and to learn defensive coding techniques.

## üìÅ Suggested repository structure

```
week1/
  README.md                # (this introduction file)
  day1/                    # contains day1/README.md with commands and lab steps
  day2/
  day3/
  day4/
  day5/
```

Each `dayX/README.md` will contain the detailed lab steps, commands, example files, expected outputs, and troubleshooting tips. This file intentionally stays conceptual and reader‚Äëfriendly.

---

## üß© Style & best practices (short)

* Prefer non‚Äëblocking updates for sequential logic to avoid simulation races.
* Avoid inferred latches by providing explicit default assignments in combinational blocks.
* Use parameters for widths and constants to make modules reusable and easier to test.
* Keep testbenches deterministic and self‚Äëchecking where possible.

---

## üìö Where to find lab commands & examples

All runnable commands, full example files, and step‚Äëby‚Äëstep instructions will be located inside the `day1/`, `day2/`, ... `day5/` folders as separate `README.md` files. That separation keeps this top‚Äëlevel introduction clean and focused on concepts.
